# P-Dining-Philosophers using Akka Actors

## Overview and Problem Description

The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science that illustrates the challenges of resource allocation and deadlock prevention in concurrent systems. In this implementation, we use Akka Actors to model the philosophers and forks, allowing for a more scalable and robust solution.
